This course covers foundational concepts, practical insights and teaches first-principles approach to building LLM applications, equipping you to systematically solve hard real-world problems using generative AI.\\nKey Value Propositions\\n\\nDeep Knowledge Course material distilled from hundreds of recent landmark papers and open-source codebases, viewed through the lens of an experienced AI practitioner.\\nFirst-Principles Approach Primary focus on core concepts and mental model development for enabling first-principle problem solving, minimizing dependency on pre-created recipes or prompts.\\nIndustry Relevance Covers methodologies and techniques honed over two decades of building industry-grade AI/ML solutions.\\nBattle-Hardened Curriculum Curriculum honed for practical mastery, derived from first-hand experience teaching internal AI lab teams, conducting bootcamps, and from mentoring top-class AI/ML professionals across the industry.\\nIlluminating Hands-on Activities Quizzes, exercises and assignments pedagogically crafted to illuminate core principles and their interactions, offering insights often missing from most AI/ML courses and tutorials.\\n\\nCourse Objectives\\n\\nFoundations of LLMs: Understand the core principles and mechanisms of LLMs, including the role of attention mechanisms, transformer architecture, auto-regressive nature, tokenization, and the training processes that enable their capabilities.\\nPrompt Engineering Mastery: Learn to craft effective prompts based on a principled understanding of LLM mechanisms, unlocking built-in parametric knowledge and steering generation through in-context learning and reasoning techniques.\\nPrincipled Hands-on Implementation: Implement concrete use cases using the LangChain framework, connecting high-level framework APIs to the core concepts and mental models learned in the course to understand what happens under the hood.\\nAdvanced RAG Techniques:  Master advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, including intuition behind embedding representations, role of reranking methods, prompt augmentation, and query transformation methods.\\nAgentic Workflows: Learn about agentic workflow patterns such as reflection, tool use, planning to power your LLM applications with multi-step, autonomous problem solving

    "Shares of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders soared 7.5 percent in trade to hit a fresh record high of Rs 4,271.20 on June 26 after the company became the latest to join the list of companies to be granted the 'Navratna' status by the Department of Public Enterprises. With this, the company became the 18th public sector undertaking (PSU) to be awarded the status.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this award, the company joined the likes of Engineers India, CONCOR, Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics, RCF, NALCO, NMDC, RVNL, IRCON and IREDA, all of which hold the 'Navratna' status.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Navratna status, Mazagon Dock gets the authority to invest up to Rs 1,000 crore without requiring approval from the central government. Additionally, it can invest up to 30 percent of its net worth annually, provided it does not exceed Rs 1,000 crore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navratna companies also have the flexibility to form joint ventures, establish alliances, and set up subsidiaries abroad.\n",
    "To qualify as a Navratna company, a PSU must first achieve Miniratna status. It must then maintain a net profit of Rs 5,000 crore annually for three consecutive years, along with either an average annual turnover exceeding Rs 25,000 crore or an average annual net worth surpassing Rs 15,000 crore over the same period. For FY24, Mazagon Dock reported an annual turnover of Rs 9,466 crore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the stock surged over 4 percent in the previous session as well, driven by news of progressing talks to acquire more Kalvari-class (Scorpene) submarines for the Navy. The anticipated Rs 35,000-crore deal aims to bolster India's submarine fleet significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sources reported by ET revealed that the three new submarines in discussion will be larger and incorporate advanced electronics, enhancing their operational capabilities and endurance compared to previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders  is a government-owned PSU operating under the Ministry of Defence, it serves as the designated shipyard responsible for constructing naval vessels and submarines for the Indian Navy. Hence, the Rs 35,000-crore deal to expand the Indian Navy's submarine fleet stand to directly benefit Mazagon Dock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from this, the stock has also been on a roll in recent months, buoyed by the government's push on indigenisation, rising capex for the sector and growing export opportunities. Flying high on these growth levers, the stock has already delivered more than two-fold returns in the past three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Net Sales at Rs 3,103.65 crore in March 2024 up 49.32% from Rs. 2,078.59 crore in March 2023.\n",

    "Quarterly Net Profit at Rs. 662.97 crore in March 2024 up 103.25% from Rs. 326.19 crore in March 2023.\n",

    "Shares of PSU companies, seen as the major beneficiaries of policy continuity with the return of the BJP to power, saw an intense selloff in the past two sessions after the Modi-led party failed to achieve a majority on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharp profit booking amid concerns of a lag in policy continuity as the BJP needs to take support from its allies to form the government for a third time weighed heavily on these counters. As a result, most of these stocks hit their lower circuits in the past two sessions.\n",
